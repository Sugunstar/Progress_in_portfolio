# Day 1
- Cursor Mask Reveal – Brief Explanation

This component creates an interactive cursor-based mask reveal animation built using **AI** assistance and developed inside **Framer Workspace**.
As the user moves their cursor, a smooth **animated mask ** follows it and reveals the background image through the foreground layer. **The mask supports multiple shapes** (circle, square, rounded, or custom image) and customizable size and follow speed.

**On click, the mask expands** to reveal the entire background, fades out the foreground image, and displays centered text with a smooth animated entrance. The animation uses **spring-based motion** for a natural feel and dynamically adapts to the container size, making it fully responsive and Framer-friendly.

- Upcoming Improvements
I am planning to improve the animation further, including smoother transitions, refined easing, and enhanced interaction details to make the experience more immersive.
